## Adding New Artifacts

When adding new reports or analysis documents:

1. Create a dated subdirectory: `reports/YYYY-MM-DD/`
2. Use descriptive filenames
3. Update this README with a brief description
4. Follow markdown formatting for consistency

## Archive Policy

- Keep all historical reports for reference
- Major project milestones should have dedicated report folders
