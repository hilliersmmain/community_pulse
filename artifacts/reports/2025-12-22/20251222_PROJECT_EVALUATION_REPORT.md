community_pulse/
├── app.py                    # Main Streamlit application (908 lines, well-organized)
├── requirements.txt          # All dependencies pinned to compatible versions
├── utils/                    # Modular utilities (5 files, ~41KB total)
│   ├── data_generator.py    # Synthetic data creation with configurable messiness
│   ├── cleaner.py           # Data cleaning pipeline with logging
│   ├── visualizer.py        # Plotly chart generation
│   ├── health_metrics.py    # Data quality scoring algorithms
│   └── ui_helpers.py        # UI components and messages

```

**Assessment:** ✅ **Excellent**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular design with reusable components
- No code duplication
- Logical file organization

#### 1.2 Code Documentation
- ✅ **All modules have comprehensive docstrings**
- ✅ **Type hints used throughout** (e.g., `def calculate_completeness_score(self) -> float:`)
- ✅ **Inline comments for complex logic**
- ✅ **Function signatures clearly document parameters and return values**

**Example from `health_metrics.py`:**
```python
def calculate_completeness_score(self) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the completeness score based on non-null values.
    
    Returns:
        float: Completeness score between 0 and 100
    """
```

#### 1.3 Code Style & Conventions
- ✅ **Consistent naming conventions** (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for classes)
- ✅ **Follows PEP 8 standards**
- ✅ **No unnecessary complexity** (functions are focused and single-purpose)
- ✅ **Professional code structure**

---

### 2. Testing & Quality Assurance ✅

#### 2.1 Test Coverage
```
Test Suite Results: 59/59 PASSING ✅

Breakdown by Module:
- test_cleaner.py          : 7 tests  ✅
- test_health_metrics.py   : 19 tests ✅
- test_ui_helpers.py       : 15 tests ✅
- test_visualizer.py       : 18 tests ✅

Total Runtime: 1.42 seconds
```

#### 2.2 Test Quality
**Strengths:**
- ✅ Tests cover edge cases (empty DataFrames, missing columns, invalid data)
- ✅ Tests validate both happy path and error conditions
- ✅ Statistical calculations are tested for accuracy
- ✅ UI helper functions tested for consistency
- ✅ Chart generation tested with various data states

**Example Test Quality:**
```python
def test_completeness_score_empty_dataframe(self):
    """Edge case: Empty DataFrame should return 0.0"""
    empty_df = pd.DataFrame()
    metrics = DataHealthMetrics(empty_df)
    assert metrics.calculate_completeness_score() == 0.0
```

#### 2.3 Functional Testing
**Manual Testing Performed:**
- ✅ Data generation works across all messiness levels (low, medium, high)
- ✅ Cleaning pipeline processes data correctly
- ✅ Duplicate removal verified (10 duplicates removed from 110 records → 100 clean records)
- ✅ Email validation and fixing works (invalid formats corrected or removed)
- ✅ Date standardization successful
- ✅ Missing value handling confirmed

**Test Results:**
```
Raw data shape: (110, 9)
Cleaned data shape: (100, 9)

Cleaning log:
  Standardized Names to Title Case.
  Fixed email formatting. Removed 0 invalid emails.
  Removed 10 duplicate rows.
  Standardized Dates. Imputed 20 missing/bad dates with mode.
  Filled 6 missing Attendance records with 0.
```

#### 2.4 Minor Observation
⚠️ **Note:** The `data_generator.py` module does not have a dedicated test file (`test_data_generator.py`). However:
- Manual testing confirms all functionality works correctly
- The module is used extensively by other tests
- This is a minor gap that doesn't affect production readiness

**Recommendation:** Consider adding `test_data_generator.py` for completeness, but this is **optional** and not blocking.
