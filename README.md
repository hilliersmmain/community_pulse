**Transforming messy, raw member data into actionable insights.**

Community Pulse is a demonstration of pure Python data engineering and dashboarding. It takes simulated "dirty" CRM data—riddled with duplicates, typos, and missing values—and passes it through an automated cleaning pipeline to power a live interactive dashboard.

Developed using AI-assisted workflows with GitHub Copilot and Google Antigravity, reflecting modern AI-driven development practices.

## 🎯 What It Does

1.  **Generates Entropy:** Creates a highly realistic "messy" dataset (simulating a nonprofit's exported CSV).
2.  **Cleans Automatically:** Uses a custom `DataCleaner` class to fix emails, merge duplicates, and standardize dates.
3.  **Visualizes Impacts:** Shows immediate "Before vs. After" metrics and interactive Plotly charts of the cleaned data.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Automated Data Cleaning Pipeline:** Handles duplicates, fuzzy string matching (names), and type coercion.
- **Comprehensive Data Health Metrics:** Real-time calculation of data quality scores across completeness, duplicates, and formatting.
- **Dynamic State Management:** Toggle between raw and cleaned data views with live KPI updates.
- **Before/After Comparison:** Side-by-side visualization of data quality improvements.
- **Interactive Tooltips:** User-friendly explanations for all metrics and KPIs.
- **Timestamp Tracking:** Automatic tracking and display of data operation timestamps.
- **Interactive Analytics:** Real-time Plotly charts for attendance trends, role distribution, and engagement.
- **AI-Lite Prediction:** Simple moving average logic to project future attendance.
- **Professional UI:** Built with Streamlit for a clean, responsive user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
